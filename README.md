# üê∂ Find Your Soulmate

Hey there! This is my take on a dog adoption app for Fetch. It‚Äôs a clean, React-powered tool to help you find your dream pup. Search by breed, age, or zip code, save your favorites, and let the app pick a match just for you. It‚Äôs got a slick design, dark mode toggle, and map pop-ups everything you need to adopt with ease.

## Why It‚Äôs Cool

This was a fun challenge from Fetch! I loved splitting it into neat modules and making it smooth to use. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did building it.
